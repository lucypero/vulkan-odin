- might not need to amke two debugmessengercreateinfo's.. try getting read of the populate proc

- some vulkan functions need to be loaded after the vulkan instance has been created.. gb's vulkan script needs some work.. you need a different loader for those functions that take vk_instance and they need to be called after vkCreateInstance

- the debug callback doesn't seem to work..
